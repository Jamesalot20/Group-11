Plan to use Javascript,Nodejs,MongoDb, and React. TechTonic is an E-commerce store that sells different computer parts. The goal is for the software to support: 
- Users  with  different  roles  (Buyer,  Seller,  Admin)  should  be  able  to  login  into  their 
accounts to be able to perform different actions and logout. 
- A buyer should be able to search, compare, buy and return different types of products 
from different sellers. 
- A seller should be able to add, sell and receive payments for their available products. 
- An admin should be able to approve/block  new  user  accounts  and  products,  and 
oversee different user actions.

These goals represent some of the features we intend to have like buying products, selling products, searching for products, comparing the price of products, and returning products.
